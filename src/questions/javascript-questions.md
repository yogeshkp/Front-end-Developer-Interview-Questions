## Coding questions
* Make this work:
```javascript
duplicate([1,2,3,4,5]); // [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]
```
* Create a for loop that iterates up to `100` while outputting **"fizz"** at multiples of `3`, **"buzz"** at multiples of `5` and **"fizzbuzz"** at multiples of `3` and `5`
* What will be returned by each of these?
```javascript
console.log("hello" || "world")
console.log("foo" && "bar")
```
How would you merge two sorted array?

function mergeSortedArray(a, b){
  var merged = [], 
      aElm = a[0],
      bElm = b[0],
      i = 1,
      j = 1;
  
  if(a.length ==0)
    return b;
  if(b.length ==0)
    return a;
  /* 
  if aElm or bElm exists we will insert to merged array
  (will go inside while loop)
   to insert: aElm exists and bElm doesn't exists
             or both exists and aElm < bElm
    this is the critical part of the example            
  */
  while(aElm || bElm){
   if((aElm && !bElm) || aElm < bElm){
     merged.push(aElm);
     aElm = a[i++];
   }   
   else {
     merged.push(bElm);
     bElm = b[j++];
   }
  }
  return merged;
}

> mergeSortedArray([2,5,6,9], [1,2,3,29]);
 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 29]
